Library Management System
A web-based application developed using Django for the backend to manage library operations such as user authentication, book inventory, borrowing and returning records, and overdue tracking. The frontend is planned to include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but the current implementation focuses on backend development.

Feel free to customize it further or let me know if you'd like to include any additional details!
